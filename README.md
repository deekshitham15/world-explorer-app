# World Explorer üåç

A web application that serves as a dynamic country information browser. Users can search for any country and view details like its capital, population, region, official name, and currency. This project is built using Node.js for the backend, Express.js for routing, and EJS as the templating engine to render dynamic content. It fetches all country data from the free and open-source **REST Countries API**.

-   **Country Search:** Find specific countries by typing their name into the search bar.
-   **Detailed Information:** Click on any country to see more in-depth details like its official name, languages, and currency.
-   **Dynamic Content:** Data is fetched in real-time from the REST Countries API.
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is styled with CSS to provide a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment.
-   **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for building the server and handling API requests.
-   **EJS:** An embedded JavaScript templating engine for generating dynamic HTML.
